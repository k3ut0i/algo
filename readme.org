 - Linear Sieve Segfaults for n > 1666680 (we reach a point where ~int~ is not sufficient for storing the numbers). I should only use this implementation for numbers less than 10^6.
 - a simple adaptation of linear sieve to get the smallest prime factor of a number.
 - Implemented [[./linearsieve.org][lisp]] version.
